## Notes

### New agenda items

- Goal for the day: Review [Stephanies user personas](https://github.com/cng-education/curriculum/issues/11#issuecomment-3161128841)
- Curriculum design
    - Follow carpenties' lead (see: https://swcarpentry.github.io/git-novice/):
        - Chunk the lessons up 
        - Index the chunks well
        - Set expectations (prerequesites, outcomes) at the beginning of each chunk
        - Enables a "build your own adventure approach"
        - Personas don't describe everyone in a category, e.g. geographers. Personas act as a lens for us to design the curriculum for various perspectives. Not necessarily a user interface element, e.g. Click the "I am a geographer" button and then be taken to relevant lessons.
            - An extra in the future could be persona-based entry-points, but avoiding that up-front will help us reduce the scope and make it easier to start.
    - If we're defining preqreqs for the lessons, what about building a DAG of lessons that enables users to explore the dependency graph of the materials? (visualize as a graph?)
    - Introductory materials shoudl be project-focused with a cool outcome!
        - But important to have deeply-referenced content backing up the instructional materials
        - Could start with hand-holdy, high-level, cool, on-rails example to help people visualize themselves doing cool stuff, then dig in to the more "boring" examples.
- What do we do next? How do we move from planning to doing?


### What's our current strategy?

* Personas are a lens for design
* Build curriculum in a way that users can "create their own adventure"
    * Defining prereqs and outcomes, maybe link lessons together to generate a map 
    
#### Next step

Pick one initial scope, e.g. raster data
* Evaluate [existing resources](https://github.com/cng-education/curriculum/issues/2) ([e.g.](https://github.com/auspatious/cloud-native-geospatial-eo-workshop)) against persona lenses as a starting point.
* Once we have content ideas, what technology are we using to display / publish? Quarto?
