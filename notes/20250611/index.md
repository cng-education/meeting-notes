## Notes

* See GitHub: https://github.com/cng-education
    * Issues: https://github.com/cng-education/curriculum/issues
* User types (https://github.com/cng-education/curriculum/issues/11):
    * Create a "why" so they want to go down the different paths
    * Software background, no GIS experience
    * Geography backgrounds, no programming experience -- ArcGIS user
        * People who use ArcGIS but hate it? :laughing:
            * Mad about "Error 9999" AGAIN?
            * Bugs that haven't been fixed for half a decade or more?
            * Want more automation?
            * Youssef: Engage ArcGIS users where there are, e.g. design notebooks for running in ArcPro.
    * Project manager: Needs to engage in strategy discussions with developers and possibly geographers, researchers.
      Need conceptual understanding. Why is cloud native important strategically?
      Why should they say "yes" to their team?
        * Want to understand at the conceptual level
    * Farmer who wants to do some analysis on their field:
      where are the boulders?
      Where are my irrigation lines?
      Where are the floodgates?
      Not a programmer.
* Map of the landscape as the entrypoint to all of this
    * Think "ThoughtWorks tech radar"-ish?
* https://www.earthdatascience.org/courses/ (example)
* Existing resources (https://github.com/cng-education/curriculum/issues/2)
* On targeting ESRI / ArcGIS users?
    * Need a license to build and test any tutorials we make
    * ESRI is a huge company, they should assign their employees to work on that type of material
    * Other ethical concerns with advancing the ESRI machine over open source alternatives
    * ArcGIS Notebooks are just Jupyter Notebooks, rebranded; some ESRI users don't know what Jupyter is!
