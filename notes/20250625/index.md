## Attendees

Your name / org / github handle

* Michelle Roby / Radiant Earth / @PowerChell
* Jarrett Keifer / Element 84 / @jkeifer
* Matt Fisher / Schmidt DSE / @mfisher87
* Youssef Harby / @Youssef-Harby


## Action items

- [ ] Michelle: Create a "dumping ground" Google doc for concepts and tools
    - [ ] Michelle: Create 4 tabs and start brain-dumping: Concepts, tools, roles, other. Unstructured.
    - [ ] All: Start populating stuff!
    - [ ] Hopefully Michelle: Go through issues, redirect folks to the new doc.
- [ ] All: Think about / research what does it mean to make our docs "Ai-ready"?
- [ ] Matt: Set up infrastructure for meeting notes.


## Notes

* Where we left off:
    * We think a high-level mapping of the ecosystem would be a valuable tool
    * Start by thinking of a persona who has no GIS or programming knowledge.
    * "Total newcomer" / "project manager"
        * The only difference is how deep they go; they both probably want overview-level information
* Structure of the materials:
    * Give people the words & links they need to learn more
    * "What does cloud-optimized mean?"
    * https://guide.cloudnativegeo.org/glossary.html
    * What kind of jobs and roles exist in this ecosystems? What unique challenges do they face?
* Next steps:
    * Explore concept mapping. What type of map would newcomers want?
        * Tyler's obsidian map: https://github.com/tylere/obsidian-vault-cng
        * Youssef's PDF map: https://cloudnativegeo.slack.com/files/U07AM35HJKS/F0913R58J6N/cng-infrastructure-concept.pdf
        * ThoughtWorks radar: https://www.thoughtworks.com/en-us/radar
        * Element84 radar: https://element84.com/geospatial-tech-radar-24/
        * Is a "radar" useful for newcomers?
            * More for established teams evaluating tools?
            * Important to map concepts/abstractions, not software tools. E.g. understanding the concept of "Chunking"
            * From zoomed-out to zoomed-in: Motivations/problems -> concepts/abstractions -> tools/solutions
        * What about timelines? Show problems we've faced at different eras of
          geospatial computing, how we've solved them, what new problems were revealed,
          and how we solved those, and so on.
* **Things that we want to exist** - which have the best ratio of
  usefulness:achievableness and/or uniqueness:achievableness?
    * Timeline view of technology & concepts
    * Map view of technology & concepts
    * Clear definition of "What is cloud native?"
    * What kind of jobs and roles exist?
* Resources
    * https://zarr.eopf.copernicus.eu/knowledge-and-tools/
        * Uses a "tagging" system to break the dataset down across multiple axes. The
          type of the information (general or technical), the user persona, the
          complexity level, theme, etc.
    * https://eopf-sample-service.github.io/eopf-sample-notebooks/gallery
* Ai-readiness of docs
    * What does this look like? We don't know! We need to learn.
    * https://www.chakra-ui.com/blog/06-making-docs-ai-friendly
* We need a dumping ground for ideas. Where is the dumping ground? Google Docs, GitHub markdown docs, HackMD docs?
    - GoogleDocs. +: Comments are part of the comment. -: Access control
        - Viewable by default, liberally grant access.
    - GitHub. + History is easier to control, access less of a mess
    - Decision: Use google docs.
