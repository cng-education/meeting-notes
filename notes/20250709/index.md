    - Webpage: https://cng-education.github.io/meeting-notes/
- Shared doc for gathering technologies, concepts, etc.: https://docs.google.com/document/d/127cRbNW1KlpBX5wjLRAXHJyGWYVetJxXKtuAwpGzbNA/edit?usp=sharing
- Have some non-CNG stuff on there, but indicate the importance of that thing.
- Brings back the timeline idea and the importance of how it connects to stuff outside the CNG community
    - Think of "vector" and "raster" as y-axis bins, and the x-axis binned into generations / eras over time.
- Tyler: A good example of describing tech using history: https://earthmover.io/blog/fundamentals-what-is-cloud-optimized-scientific-data
- Tyler's network visualization of technologies: https://github.com/tylere/obsidian-vault-cng
    - How useful is this style of visualization for learners?
    - Maybe spatial clustering would help
    - Dynamic filtering, interface for exploring the data points.
